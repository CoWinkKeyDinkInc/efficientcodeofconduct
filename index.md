This code of conduct outlines most of our expectations for participants within the **[COMMUNITY]** community, as well as steps to reporting rule-breaking. We are committed to providing a welcoming and friendly community for all and expect our code of conduct to be honored. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be banned from the community.

Our community strives to:

* **Be friendly and patient.**
* **Be welcoming**: We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, appearance, political beliefs, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* **Be considerate**: Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will use the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that we're a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else's primary language.
* **Maintain a calm and casual atomosphere**:  Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable, threatened or where things go off-topic is not a productive one.
* **Be respectful**: We are a community made of many different people, and we will conduct ourselves politely. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren't acceptable.  In other words, just follow the [Golden Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule), and you will be fine!
* **Try to understand why others may disagree**: Disagreements happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.  The strength of communities comes from diversity and people from a wide range of backgrounds. People have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to make errors and mistakes and that blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Definitions

Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable.  This includes, but is not limited to:

- Distasteful and offensive comments related to race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, disability, appearance, age, and other statuses.
- Violent threats or language
- Intimidating people
- Stalking
- The use of photography, logs of online activity and other recordings for harassment purposes
- Disrupting casual discussion
- Unwanted sexual attention
- Deliberately releasing or sharing personal information without permission (privately or publicly) except when needed to prevent abuse
- Spam

Our community prioritizes people’s safety over people’s comfort. We will not act on complaints regarding:

- Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you”
- Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t like
- Being "annoying"
- Political disagreements


### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate into building a community for all. We seek to treat everyone both fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it.

Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we will treat people the same, regardless of age, gender, ethnicity, language skill, national origin, race, religion, sexual orientation, disabilities and other statuses. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above.

### Reporting Issues

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting us via **[CONTACT]**. All reports will be handled in private. In your report please include:

- Your contact info.
- Names (real or nicknames) of any individuals involved.
- Your story of what occurred, and if the incident is ongoing. If there is publicly available records (e.g. forum post, a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), link it.
- Any additional information that may be helpful.

After filing a report, a staff member will contact you personally, review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond. If the person who is harassing you is part of the staff, it will be handled by a staff member higher up. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting people of abuse.
